There was once a student named Edmundo Edmontonio, who lived in Madison WI in a cheap apartment over an all-night bowling alley for the blind. In his neverending quest to better himself, he was taking a class that was unimaginatively titled "Programming III". Unfortunately, he didn't know bupkis about programming, and being somewhat low on moral fiber he had been stealing code from the internet to use in his assignments. Edmundo cheated, stole, and lied in every facet of life, but he knew that one day the long arm of the law would catch up with him, so he drank like a fish to avoid thinking about it.
